title = "Higher-order interactions shape collective dynamics differently in hypergraphs and simplicial complexes"
authors = ["Zhang, Y.", "Lucas, M.", "Battiston, F."]
abstract= "Higher-order interactions, through which three or more entities interact simultaneously, are important to the faithful modeling of many real-world complex systems. Recent efforts have focused on elucidating the effects of these nonpairwise interactions on the collective behaviors of coupled systems. Interestingly, several examples of higher-order interactions promoting synchronization have been found, raising speculations that this might be a general phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate that even for simple systems such as Kuramoto oscillators, the effects of higher-order interactions are highly nuanced. In particular, we show numerically and analytically that hyperedges typically enhance synchronization in random hypergraphs, but have the opposite effect in simplicial complexes. As an explanation, we identify higher-order degree heterogeneity as the key structural determinant of synchronization stability in systems with a fixed coupling budget. Typical to nonlinear systems, we also capture regimes where pairwise and nonpairwise interactions synergize to optimize synchronization. Our work contributes to a better understanding of dynamical systems with structured higher-order interactions."

title = "Simplicially driven simple contagion"
authors = ["Lucas, M.","Iacopini, I."," Robiglio, T.","Barrat, A.","Petri, G."]
abstract= "Single contagion processes are known to display a continuous transition from an epidemic-free phase at low contagion rates to the epidemic state for rates above a critical threshold. This transition can become discontinuous when two simple contagion processes are coupled in a bi-directional symmetric way. However, in many cases, the coupling is not symmetric and the processes can be of a different nature. For example, social behaviors---such as hand-washing or mask-wearing---can affect the spread of a disease, and their adoption dynamics via social reinforcement mechanisms are better described by complex contagion models, rather than by the simple contagion paradigm, which is more appropriate for disease spreading phenomena. Motivated by this example, we consider a simplicial contagion (describing the adoption of a behavior) that uni-directionally drives a simple contagion (describing a disease propagation). We show that, above a critical driving strength, such driven simple contagion can exhibit both discontinuous transitions and bi-stability, which are instead absent in standard simple contagions. We provide a mean-field analytical description of the phase diagram of the system, and complement the results with Markov-chain simulations. Our results provide a novel route for a simple contagion process to display the phenomenology of a higher-order contagion, through a driving mechanism that may be hidden or unobservable in many practical instances."

title = "Networks beyond pairwise interactions: structure and dynamics"
authors = ["Battiston, F.","Cencetti, G.","Iacopini, I.","Latora, V.","Lucas, M.","Patania, A." ,"Young, J.-G.","Petri, G."]
abstract= "The complexity of many biological, social and technological systems stems from the richness of the interactions among their units. Over the past decades, a variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, from human communications to chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can often occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be described simply in terms of dyads. Until recently little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can enhance our modeling capacities and help us understand and predict their dynamical behavior. Here we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We discuss how to represent higher-order interactions and introduce the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing bipartite graphs, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We introduce the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and dynamical topology, discussing the relations between higher-order interactions and collective behavior. We focus in particular on new emergent phenomena characterizing dynamical processes, such as diffusion, synchronization, spreading, social dynamics and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We conclude with a summary of empirical applications, and an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers."

title = "On The Topological Expressive Power of Neural Networks"
authors = ["Petri, G.","Leitao, A."]
abstract= "We propose a topological description of neural network expressive power. We adopt the topology of the space of decision boundaries realized by a neural architecture as a measure of its intrinsic expressive power. By sampling a large number of neural architectures with different sizes and design, we show how such measure of expressive power depends on the properties of the architectures, like depth, width and other related quantities.
