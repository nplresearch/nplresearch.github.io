title = "Navigating the Research Frontier of AI and Complexity: CENTAI's Kick-off Event"
description = "The kick-off meeting is meant to be an occasion for the scientific community and current as well as potential stakeholders to learn about the institute's vision, ambitious goals and ongoing research projects. The event will gather together leaders of several scientific fields and will showcase CENTAIâ€™s research in a host of areas, joined together through a shared quiver of multidisciplinary tools, and approaches that combine AI, complex systems science, new economic thinking, and behavioral sciences. The meeting will be a forum to discuss how to further advance CENTAI's basic assumption that mankind's most pressing problems can be approached with the growing asset of methods and conceptual tools of science, embodied in the most rigorous principles of ethics, which will enable innovative solutions to some of today's most pressing societal challenges."
